# Vinted discount application homework task

![example workflow](https://github.com/ArnasVaic/DiscountApp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

I'm not applying, just doing this for fun.
The gist link is secret so I cannot post it here.

## Running the application

If you have the `dotnet` cli installed, checkout and run `dotnet run -- input.txt`.
If you want to use the executable, you can do `./discount-app input.txt`.
